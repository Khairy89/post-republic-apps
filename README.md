# Courier Service Project

## Project Overview

This is a modern courier service management platform tailored for DHL shipments, built to simplify postage operations for both users and administrators. The system allows customers to create delivery orders, check pricing based on destination zones using a stored DHL rate card, and track their shipments in real-time.

Users must sign in with their own credentials to view their order history, track previous shipments, and manage new requests. On the backend, admins manage pricing data, order records, and zone mappings using Supabase as the database and authentication platform.

Key highlights:

- User authentication with personalized order history

- Dynamic pricing based on country zones and DHL rate card

- Real-time shipment tracking

- Admin dashboard powered by Supabase for data management
